# Tako protocol

## Protocol Overview

Tako is an open recommendation protocol, designed to cater to the paradigm shift in content recommendation and distribution from traditional social networks to Web3 social graphs.

The Tako Protocol aims to counter centralization issues with a peer-to-peer and value-matching recommendation model. Compared to centralized models, this approach offers content creators a more personalized and efficient way to reach their target audiences and monetize user-targeted advertisements.

This shift from 'Platform as a Curator' to 'User as a Curator' enables all participants to earn rewards by contributing to a Referral Economy, where value is channeled directly to users, and jointly facilitating the content value flow in Web3 Social.

## Contracts

Tako has integrated with Lens and is currently integrating with more social graphs, such as Farcaster.

Tako has developed contracts based on Polygon and has deployed them on both the mainnet and testnet.
